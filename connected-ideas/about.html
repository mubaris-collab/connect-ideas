    <h1>About Connect Ideas</h1>
Connect Ideas is a student-built web platform that helps turn creative university projects into real opportunities. It allows students and young innovators to pitch their ideas in a simple, structured way, while investors or mentors can easily explore, evaluate, and shortlist the ideas that match their interests. Instead of ideas staying limited to classroom presentations or one-time competitions, Connect Ideas provides a central space where they can be viewed, compared, and tracked. This project has been developed by Business Analytics students of Bahria University Karachi Campus as part of the Web and Application Development course, with the aim of combining business thinking and basic web development skills to support innovation within the university environment.
